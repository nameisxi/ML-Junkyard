# Kaggle 
### House Price Prediction Exercise
[This was my first machine learning exercise, and well, it probably seems like it. The exercise was pretty structured, but I tried to make mine a bit different and experiment on the go, as often as possible. My solution only uses a simple decision tree to make the house price predictions, but I think that it turned out to be just fine, even though there is some room for improvement.](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nameisxi/ML-Junkyard/blob/master/Kaggle/Housing-Prices-Prediction-Exercise/Kaggle-House-Price-Prediction-Exercise.ipynb)

### House Price Prediction Competition
[This was my first Kaggle competition submission, and it's basically only an improved version of my earlier house price prediction exercise. This time instead of decision trees I decided to use random forest regressor, and it turned out to lower the error from 18K USD to roughly 10K USD. My final placement in this competition is in the top 84%.](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nameisxi/ML-Junkyard/blob/master/Kaggle/Housing-Prices-Prediction-Competition/Kaggle-House-Price-Prediction-Competition-Solution.ipynb)
