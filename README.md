### House Price Prediction Exercise
This was my first machine learning exercise, and well, it probably seems like it. The exercise was pretty structured, but I tried to make mine a bit different and experiment on the go, as often as possible. My solution only uses a simple decision tree to make the house price predictions, but I think that it turned out to be just fine, even though there is some room for improvement.
